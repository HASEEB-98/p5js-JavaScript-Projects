# p5js-JavaScript-Projects

This repository contains JavaScript projects using the p5.js library.

## How to Run:

All projects are written in JavaScript and use the p5.js library. You can run/execute the projects by simply opening the `index.html` file of each project with a live server.

## Details About the Projects:

### Solar System:
This project draws a replica of the solar system, featuring the Sun, Earth, and two moons. The Earth revolves around the Sun, while the moons orbit the Earth at different speeds.

### Asteroid Game Clone:
This is a shooting space game where players can destroy asteroids moving towards Earth using a spaceship. The game can include special features such as increasing difficulty as the game progresses, power-ups for the spaceship, and score recording.

### Angry Bird Clone:
Similar to Angry Birds, this game involves firing balls towards a stack of boxes with the goal of removing all the boxes from the screen. Players can also spawn balls by pressing 'b' at the position of the cursor pointer. A time limit adds to the challenge.

### Waving Dots:
This project displays a graph of dots moving in a sine wave pattern. Users can change the speed of the moving dots using the mouse cursor.

### 3D Sin Game:
This project displays rotating square boxes with continuous curves. Users can adjust the height, rotation speed, size of the box, and size of confetti thrown towards the shape using slide bars.

### Average Face:
Using multiple face images, this project computes the average face by analyzing them. The left side displays the input images, while the right side shows the average face. Users can change the input images by pressing any key.

### Instagram Filter:
This project applies filters to any uploaded image, including brightness adjustment, thresholding, inversion, and sharpening. Users can also download the filtered image.

### Webcam Piano:
Utilizing the webcam, this project displays movement on screen in a color pattern, potentially resembling piano keys or other interactive elements.
